# TESoftTextEditor
Now you can edit text in 4 Sega Mega Drive golf Games!
This Python app will search and create a dataset of all the Japanese caddie dialog in any of the 4 T&amp;E Golf games on the Sega Mega Drive.  You can then select a string and edit it into English within the text box.  The app can then compile all the new dialog strings and write them back to the rom.  

Summary:
